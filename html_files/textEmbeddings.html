        <h1>Text Embeddings</h1>
        <p>In order to analyze the rules given by users in the Glyph data, I used text embeddings to generate vectorized 
            versions of the data, and then clustered them using kmeans.</p>
        <p>The first step of the process was to clean the data. I isolated the rows where the rule had been passed by the user, made everything lowercase, and then filtered out stop words/phrases.
            For this project, the stop phrases I identified included things such as "characters with" and "letters containing" which many users included in their rules.
            Without this filtering, the clusters would end up clustering all responses with those phrases included, which was not relevant to my analysis.
        </p>
        <p>Once the data was cleaned, I used a sentence BERT model to generate embeddings for each rule. I originally used the <i>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</i>, 
            but found that the non-English rules were clustered together and instead used the multilingual model <i>paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2</i>.
            Once the rules had been embedded, I used kmeans clustering to look for sets of similar rules. The goal was to create a list of rules that could be used universally across scripts,
            supplementing the original list created by more manual data observation. When clustering, there was no clear elbow in the inertia test, so I stuck with cluster numbers around 20-30,
            since these were manageable to look through but wouldn't oversimplify the data too much.
        </p>
