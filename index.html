                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I am Zoe Stephens, a third-year student at Wellesley College majoring in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Computer Science. </p>

                1: What are you currently doing (in regard to your career) and how did you get there?
                I love all things science, and am currently focused around computer science, linguistics, biology, and math. I am currently working in a bio lab, researching behavioral patterns of southern giant hornets in nests, and working on a socio-linguistics proceedings paper on the effects of text-formatting on personae formation. My broad interest in the sciences allow me to bring a multidisciplinary viewpoint to my projects, and better understand the intersection of different fields. I believe strongly in passion and curiosity as the driving factors of innovation.

                2: In terms of the work you do, what aspects are you most passionate about and why?
                I am a puzzle lover, and I enjoy working long hours searching for patterns and conclusions. Data science techniques are my tools of choice, and it is always satisfying to see where the data falls. I am eager to build off of my foundation and contribute to an ever-growing body of scientific research. I love diving deep into a topic and learning all there is to know about it, both in order to further myself and create meaningful conversation with those I am involved with.

                3: What do you consider some of your biggest professional and personal accomplishments?
                My passion for science and research led me to have my first authorship while still in high school (see more in publications). I have continued this work ethic while building an experiment in sociolinguistics, an understudied field. Even without a lot of contemporary research to build off of, I worked to create, disseminate, and analyze results from this experiment, and I am excited to continue building off of our results.

                4: What are you looking for right now?
                I am always looking for new ways to be involved in the research community. Reach out to zoestephe@gmail.com to connect!
