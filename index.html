        <h1>About the Glyph Project</h1>
        <p>Glyph (<a href="https://glyph.shh.mpg.de/home">https://glyph.shh.mpg.de/home</a>) is a webapp created to collect data on how people categorize letters in various scripts. 
            Each user is given a script and told to categorize the letters into two groups based on whether or not they follow a rule of the user's choice. 
            The user picks the letters and inputs the rule. After a 3 minute time break, the user can play their rule.
            In order to play a rule, the user is given their rule and must pick the same combination of letters as they did originally. 
            This is to ensure that the rules input are valid and reproducible, with the timer to limit the feasibility of memorizing the character collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Glyph project was created to investigate the way that people process the written shapes of letters and how those letters relate to one another.
            The data from the project is used to examine the distance between letters and their relationships between and within scripts.
